# Fibonacci Exercise

There is no starter code for this assignment. Use the code in our example repository and the stats assignment as a guide to help you.

**NOTE:** Do **NOT** modify the files `fib_nums` and `tests.c`. They are used to test your program. You may compile your `fibonacci.c` along with the `tests.c`
program to evaluate your fibonacci function with the same tests that GitHub will run before submission.

See the class website for assignment details!
